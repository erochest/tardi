# Tardi

Short for _tardigrade_, because why not?

But in this context, this is a small, stack-based language for me to play with.

## Subrepositories

I currently have this project in a monorepo. Here are the different subrepositories:

- [tree-sitter-tardi](tree-sitter-tardi/README.md) has the tree-sitter parser
  for the language.

## Dependencies

You'll need these tools installed to get this running:

- [Justfile](https://just.systems/)
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Build

To build everything and run the tests, from the main directory, run `just`:

```sh
just
```
