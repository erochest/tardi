  - Macro system for compile-time metaprogramming
  - Conditional execution with if-else constructs
  - Recursive function support
  - Lambda expressions with closure support
  - Bootstrapped core language features

- Tardi Orchestrator:

  - Bootstrap process handling
  - REPL and file execution support

- Virtual Machine:
  - Indirect Threaded Code (ITC) implementation
  - Function pointer table for operation dispatch
  - Stack-based execution with dual stack system

  - Macro execution capabilities
  - Comprehensive operation set:
    - Stack manipulation (dup, swap, rot, drop, clear)
    - Arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
    - Comparison (==, <, >, !)
    - List operations (create-list, append, prepend, concat, split-head)
    - String operations (create-string, to-string, utf8-to-string, string-concat)
    - Function operations (call, apply, return, exit, jump)
    - Return stack operations (>r, r>, r@)

- Scanner/Compiler:
  - Token generation and management
  - Macro expansion support
  - Bytecode generation
  - Function compilation
  - Support for:
    - Numbers (integers, floats)
    - Strings and characters
    - Lists and arrays
    - Functions and lambdas
    - Macros and immediate words
    - Comments

- Environment:
  - Global state management
  - Function definitions
  - Macro storage and handling
  - Bootstrap file management

- Bootstrap System:
  - Core language features defined in Tardi
  - Sorted loading of bootstrap files:
    - Core macro definitions
    - Stack operation definitions
    - Core operation definitions

- Documentation:
  - Updated project brief
  - System patterns documentation
  - Technical context
  - Active development context
  - Feature-specific documentation:
    - Stack manipulation
    - Arithmetic operations
    - Comparison operators
    - List operations
    - String operations
    - Return stack operations
    - Types and literals

- Testing Infrastructure:
  - Comprehensive test suite
  - Integration tests for all major features
  - Test fixtures for various scenarios
  - TDD workflow support

## What's Left to Build

### Near-term Goals
1. File and Console I/O Operations:
   - Basic file reading/writing
   - Console input/output

2. Hashtable Implementation:
   - Core data structure
   - Basic operations

3. FFI (Foreign Function Interface):
   - External function calling
   - Type conversion

4. Threading Support:
   - Green threads
   - OS-level threading

5. Enhanced Error Handling:
   - Stack traces
   - Better error messages
   - Error recovery

6. Package and Module System:
   - Module organization
   - Package management

### Long-term Features
- Enums and structs
- Traits/protocols
- Advanced type system
- Sets and persistent data types
- Safe concurrency framework
- LLVM compiler frontend
- Regular expression support

### Quality-of-Life Improvements
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Project website
- Language server implementation
- Tree-sitter parser
- Development tools and IDE integration

## Current Status
- Core language features implemented and working
- Bootstrap system operational
- Macro system functional
- Function and lambda support complete
- Conditional execution working
- Basic data types and operations implemented
- Test suite comprehensive and passing

## Known Issues
- Performance impact of shared values needs assessment
- Bootstrap process could be optimized
- Error messages could be more informative
- Documentation needs expansion for new features

## Next Steps
1. Implement file and console I/O operations
2. Develop hashtable implementation
3. Design and implement FFI system
4. Add threading support
5. Enhance error handling system
6. Develop package and module system
7. Continue expanding documentation
8. Profile and optimize performance

## Long-term Vision
- Create a robust, self-hosted programming language
- Build a strong standard library
- Develop comprehensive tooling
- Foster a supportive community
- Maintain excellent documentation
