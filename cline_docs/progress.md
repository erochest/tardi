  - Support for basic stack operation words (dup, swap, rot, drop)
  - Support for comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, !)
- Compiler implementation:
  - Basic structure for compiling integers, floats, and booleans
  - Uses Program structure to generate bytecode

  - Error handling for return stack operations (overflow, underflow)
  - Implementation of list operations (<list>, append, prepend, concat, split-head!)
  - Error handling for list operations (type mismatches, empty lists)
- Test infrastructure:
  - Initial test suite using cargo-nextest
  - Integration tests for major features
  - System-specific tests (Scanner, Compiler, VM)
  - Line ending normalization
  - Comprehensive tests for basic stack operations
  - Integration tests for arithmetic operations
  - Integration tests for comparison operations
  - Tests for shared value behavior
- TDD-focused workflow with emphasis on error case testing

## What's Left to Build
1. Add String Objects and Literals:
   - String type and operations
   - String manipulation primitives
5. Implement Function and Lambda Objects:
   - Function declarations and calls
   - Lambda expressions
6. Add Comment Support
7. Create Initialization Script
8. Implement Compiler Words
9. Add Scanner/Parser Words
10. Implement Metaprogramming
11. Add Lambda and Function Literals
12. Enhance Scanner:
    - Extended number formats (binary, octal, hex, rationals, exponential notation)
    - Error recovery for better reporting
13. Improve Program structure:
    - Methods for easier instruction and constant addition
    - Serialization/deserialization for programs
14. Implement module system
15. Develop basic standard library
16. File and console IO operations
17. Advanced data structures (vectors, hashtables)
18. FFI operations
19. Concurrency (Green- and OS-threading operations)

## Current Status
- Basic scanner, compiler, and VM functionality implemented
- Program structure in place for managing bytecode
- Basic stack operations (dup, swap, rot, drop) implemented across all components
- Return stack operations (>r, r>, r@) implemented across all components
- Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) implemented with type coercion and error handling
- Comparison operations (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, !) implemented across all components
- Shared value system implemented using Rc<RefCell<Value>>
- Character values and literals implemented, including Unicode support
- List operations (<list>, append, prepend, concat, split-head!) implemented across all components
- Continuing work on expanding language capabilities
- Enhancing error handling and reporting across all components
- Improving test coverage and maintaining TDD-focused workflow

## Known Issues
- Potential performance overhead from shared values (to be benchmarked)
- No significant functional issues at this stage

## Upcoming Milestones
1. Add character and string support
3. Implement list objects
4. Add function and lambda support
5. Working REPL for interactive testing
6. File execution capability
7. Basic module system
8. Initial standard library implementation

## Long-term Goals
- Comprehensive error handling and informative error messages
- Full support for all planned language features (enums, structs, traits/protocols)
- Advanced type system (possibly Hindley-Milner)
- Performance optimization (possibly revisiting Direct Threading)
- LLVM compiler frontend

## Quality-of-Life Improvements (Planned)
- Comprehensive documentation with tutorials
- Project website
- Language server
- Tree-sitter parser

## Next Steps
1. Implement String Objects and Literals:
   - Design string operations
   - Implement basic string functionality
2. Continue improving test coverage and documentation
