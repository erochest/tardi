# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Refining and expanding the Tardi language implementation
- Enhancing the bootstrap system for core language features
- Improving macro system and compile-time metaprogramming
- Expanding support for recursive functions and conditionals
- Continuing TDD-focused workflow and expanding test coverage

## Development Workflow
1. Create integration test in `tests/fixtures` for new major features
2. Work iteratively on Scanner, Compiler, VM, and Environment systems:

   b. Implement functionality
   c. Run system-specific tests
3. Verify integration tests
4. Update bootstrap files if necessary
5. Update documentation and memory bank
6. Review and adjust plans as needed
