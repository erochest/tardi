# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing the core VM operations for retrieving literal values
- Setting up the basic project structure and development environment

## Recent Changes
- Project initialization
- Creation of the project brief and initial documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement VM with core operations for retrieving literal values
2. Add operations for stack manipulation
3. Implement return stack, jumps, and operations for moving data between the data stack and return stack

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Choosing between different VM architectures for optimal performance
- Deciding on the syntax for literal values and stack operations
- Considering the best approach for implementing the return stack and jump operations

## Open Questions
- What specific literal types should be supported in the initial implementation?
- How should error handling be implemented in the VM?
- What testing strategy should be used for the VM and language features?
