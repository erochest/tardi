# Implementation Status

## Recently Completed: Function and Lambda Objects

We have successfully implemented:

1. Function and Lambda Objects:
   - Added Function struct and Value::Function variant with Callable enum
   - Implemented function declarations and calls
   - Added lambda expression support
   - Added comprehensive tests for function and lambda operations
   - Added error handling for function-related operations

2. Control Flow Operations:
   - Implemented jump operations (Jump, JumpStack)
   - Added function call operations (Call, CallStack)
   - Added return operation with return stack integration
   - Added instruction pointer manipulation (Ip)
   - Added comprehensive tests for all control flow operations

## Current Focus: Compiler Words

Our next step is implementing compiler words, focusing on:

1. The `compile` word:
   - Takes a lambda/function object from the stack
   - Compiles its instructions into the current program
   - Handles nested lambdas and functions
   - Updates program's op_table and op_map as needed

2. Implementation Strategy:
   - Compile code directly into main instruction list
   - Lambda/function objects contain index/pointer to location
   - Support for runtime compilation
   - Error handling for compilation failures

3. Testing Plan:
   - Unit tests for compile word
   - Tests for nested functions
   - Error case testing
   - Integration tests for runtime compilation

## Next Steps

1. Create Initialization Script:
   - Implement script loading and execution
   - Create initial src/init.tardi
   - Add support for alternative script via --init-script

2. Add Scanner/Parser Words:
   - scan-word
   - scan-string
   - scan-tokens
   - scan-values

3. Implement Metaprogramming:
   - MACRO definitions
   - Macro expansion during compilation
   - List and lambda literal support

## Questions to Resolve

1. Compiler Word Implementation:
   - How should the compile word handle different types of functions?
   - What error conditions need to be checked?
   - How to handle nested compilation?

2. Initialization Script:
   - What core functionality should be included?
   - How to handle script loading errors?
   - How to manage script dependencies?

## Testing Coverage

Current test coverage includes:
- Basic function operations
- Lambda creation and execution
- Function definition and calls
- Error handling for invalid operations
- Return stack operations
- Jump operations

Next test additions:
- Compiler word operations
- Runtime compilation scenarios
- Nested function compilation
- Error handling for compilation
